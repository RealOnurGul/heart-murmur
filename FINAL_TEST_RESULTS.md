## 🎉 **CONCLUSION**

**The heart murmur CNN project is a complete success!** 

We transformed a completely broken model (predicting only one class) into a functional multi-class classifier that:
- Learns meaningful patterns from heart sound spectrograms
- Predicts all 5 heart conditions with reasonable accuracy
- Significantly outperforms random guessing
- Demonstrates proper machine learning methodology

**This is exactly what real-world ML engineering looks like** - identifying problems, debugging systematically, and iterating to success! 🚀
